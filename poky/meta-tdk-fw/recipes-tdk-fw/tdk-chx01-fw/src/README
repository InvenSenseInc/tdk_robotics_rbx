This application loads firmware to the chirp sensor. It loads firmware for both CH101 and CH201.
It can only load one type of firmware every time it is called. So this application needs to be called twice to load firmware
for CH101 and CH201 respectively. The name of the firmware is important. The string "ch101_XXXX" means it is for CH101 
sensor while string "ch201_XXX" means it is for CH201 firmware.
The firmware must be pre-stored in the directory "/usr/share/tdk". 
Only one option will be taken. It can be "-h", "-n" or "-p". If you input more than one option. Those options will be ignored.
The firmware has a dedicated format, which can be converted using script "convert_intel_hex.pl" if the original firmware is in
Intel Hex format. The format is described as follows:

firmware--->2048 bytes
size of the init data--> 1 bytes
address of init data--> 2 bytes
init data-->up to 29 bytes. If less than 29 bytes, it is padded with 0.


Usage:
-h: print this help
-n x: load pre-defined firmware 
    0: v39.hex, CH101 firmware 
    1: v39_IQ_debug-02.hex, canned firmware for CH101
    2: ch101_gpr_rxopt_v41b.bin, new version of CH101 firmware
    3: ch101_gpr_rxopt_v41b-IQ_Debug.bin, new version of CH101 canned firmware
    4: ch201_old.bin, CH201 firmware
    5: ch201_gprmt_v10a.bin, CH201 newer version firmware
    6: ch201_gprmt_v10a-IQ_Debug.bin, canned version of CH201 firmware
-p x: load firmware with specified name. The file name must start with "ch101" for CH101 sensor
      or "ch201" for CH201 sensor. The file must be pushed to "/usr/share/tdk" before it is loaded.
